          <h4>Commercial and Residential Design</h4>
          <p>
            We have mastered the art of designing commercial & residential
            projects irrespective of their size, scale & location. Specialised
            Interior Architects work on these projects to understand the
            relation of the structure with the interior space.
           Approved designs are then forwarded to expert designers who
            implement latest & innovative materials thereby giving the much
            needed modern, aesthetically pleasing look to the project. The project can also be executed on
            Turnkey basis, giving the client total satisfaction in terms of
            quality & time.
          </p>

        </li>
         <li>
          <h4>General Architectural Services</h4>
          <p>
            We have over a decade, developed a team of efficient & experienced Architects who after taking directions from the Proprietor start conceptualizing the project. Our In-house consultants take the project to the next level with their skills & expertise. Chief Architect with co-ordination with the team makes 3d representation to make the client visualize to the maximum possible extent and the highest level of satisfaction.

        Our requirements have been perfectly understood by Deep Thought
        Architects who have designed our home at Samana. Each and every
        requirement was properly understood.
        The entire execution was done with best quality finishing
        and the delivery was bang on time saving on my rent money for another
        month. Hats off to Deep Thought Architects and their team for the
        fantastic job !!!

        Trust, Commitment, Integrity, Relationship, Hardwork &amp; Passion. All
        these words are so strongly associated with Deep Thought Architects that
        we have given our residence's renovation works to them for the second
        time now. Previous work was done in 2006 and in 2019 we had again
        given it to them. They have done a superb job this time as well with
        their typical style and eye for detail. We just enjoy the creative
        input into the whole process as well as the final outcome. I am sure
        Deep Thought Architects have a long way to go with their amazing work.
